      <h3>SOUTH AFRICA</h3>
      <p>
        South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the
        southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded to the south by 2,798
        kilometres (1,739 mi) of coastline that stretch along the South Atlantic
        and Indian Oceans.
      </p>
      <p>
        South Africa is, like many other countries in Africa, home to the so
        called "Big Five game animals". These consist of lion, leopard, black
        rhinoceros, African bush elephant, and African buffalo. We were lucky
        enough to see all of them but a leopard!
      </p>

        <p>
          The African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) is one of two extant
          African elephant species and one of three extant elephant species. It
          is the largest living terrestrial animal, with bulls reaching a
          shoulder height of up to 3.96 m (13 ft 0 in) and a body mass of up to
          10.4 t (11.5 short tons).
        </p>

        <!-- BUFFALO -->
        <p>
          The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a large sub-Saharan African
          bovine. Syncerus caffer caffer, the Cape buffalo, is the typical
          subspecies, and the largest one, found in Southern and East Africa. S.
          c. nanus (the forest buffalo) is the smallest subspecies, common in
          forest areas of Central and West Africa, while S. c. brachyceros is in
          West Africa and S. c. aequinoctialis is in the savannas of East
          Africa.

        <!-- LION -->
        <img src="./pics/rsa/IMG_8466.jpg" alt="A lion" />
        <p>
          The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to
          Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short,
          rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It
          is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and
          have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called
          prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females,
          and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly
          on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator;
          although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been
          known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out
          and prey on humans.

        <!-- RHINOCEROS -->
        <p>
          The black rhinoceros, black rhino or hook-lipped rhinoceros (Diceros
          bicornis) is a species of rhinoceros, native to eastern and southern
          Africa including Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
          South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Although the
          rhinoceros is referred to as black, its colours vary from brown to
          grey.

        />
        <p>
          The African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus) is the nominate
          subspecies of the leopard, native to many countries in Africa. It is
          widely distributed in most of sub-Saharan Africa, but the historical
          range has been fragmented in the course of habitat conversion.
